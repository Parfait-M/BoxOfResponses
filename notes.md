# Blessings in a box

- Program that has speech to text
- When you sneeze, it says "bless you."
- Tangible thing he wants people to do:
  - Arduino/Raspberry PI
  - He wants it to go in a box
- Go on amazon, order these parts
- Less than $50
- Programming part, Parfait provides skeloton
- Example: Sneezing captures different things (hi true), people sneeze different
- Need to train an AI on different sneezes.

## First step

- C# Console based application
- enumeration of keywords
- he wants to be able to modify responses
- Respond to me in (English, Man's voice, Woman's voice)
- Listener class listens
- Responder class responds
- Speaker class combines the two
- Once that is working, we figure out how to move on

- Google/Amazon might have similar skills out there
- Parfait is registered as an Amazon developer
- Maybe we could add to echo devices?
- This is a fun project that we can share with kids and others.
- It's not just "calculate your age"

- Started a week ago (only worked for 3ish hours)
- Fun to see that C# has a default speech library, instead of Google API.
- Has a listener, text -> speech, speech -> text.
- Trying to explore options

- Two options:
- Get it off the internet (maybe it already exists)
- Make it yourself,
